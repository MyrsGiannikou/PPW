                    I am Myrsini Giannikou, I'm a getting my bachelor degree in Digital Humanities at the University of Pisa.
                    <br>
                    I enthusiastically opted to center my final project for the PPW course around the art of sewing, a craft that holds a special place in my heart as one of my most cherished hobbies. 
                    This topic allows me to discuss something I'm genuinely passionate about while also
                    providing an avenue for learning and growth. By delving into sewing, 
                    I can share my enthusiasm and enhance my understanding of various techniques and materials.
                    <br>
                    It's a fulfilling way to combine my love for the craft with the opportunity to broaden my knowledge.
